## Project Summary

This project was meant as a tool to generate small bingo cards that would be printed out for each employee on the shift to turn minor inconceniences and common mundane tasks into objectives to keep the slow days lively at work. 

## Choice of Tools

- Vite and Vue: One of my favotire build tools at the time since I'd yet to venture into ther tools such as Svelte. 
- Tailwind: Easy styling and easy to understand and get running from zero to minimum viable product.
